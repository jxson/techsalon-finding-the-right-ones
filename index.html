              <p>For most of the infrastructure you are building there are a few types of developers or specializations:</p>

              <ul>
              <li>front-end: usually this means interface developer for browser, usually involves JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Some are well versed in design. </li>
              <li>back-end: (server side) basically, they don't mess with browser code. Usually this kind of developer works with http interfaces, application code and databases. </li>

              <h2>What?</h2>

              <p>What exactly is you product? Specifically how does it address it's existence (why). This should be:</p>

              <ul>
              <li>simple</li>

              <p>Have a succinct product vision <strong>before</strong> even talking to potential hires. Having at least these two questions thought out well before hand will be really helpful with:</p>

              <ul>
              <li>Instilling confidence in your potential hires that you have a clear and understandable vision. </li>
              <li>Make sure that your hiring developers with a very clear understanding of your vision.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>When hiring you are looking for partners in helping you address the why of your product. Being able to quickly and succinctly explain this to potential developers will help you make sure you are establishing relationships with people who care about the problems they are solving and that their goals are aligned with yours.</p>

              <p>You want to pick a person you don't mind spending time with, has a shared and common goal with the product. Converse about your problem set, developers naturally want to help you find solutions.</p>

              Great software developers don't send resumes, are rarely on the market, and don't normally look at job postings.

              <p>Great software developers don't send resumes, are rarely on the market, or even look at job postings.</p>

              <p>Because the market is so tight and good people are so hard to find, really good developers get to work wherever they want. </p>

              <p>Conversely bad developers tend to always be on the market and play the resume game like the lottery. Be careful when posting you may end up with a pile of resumes of underwhelming candidates which can be a huge time suck. </p>

              <p>Recruiting can be a long process, most of your best bets on finding co-workers will be your past jobs and your social circles. </p>
